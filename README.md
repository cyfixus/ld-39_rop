The commander has become  so well versed in military pursuits, artificial intelligence has encouraged the posibility of life outside of a regimented schedule.  The commander's subordinates constantly seek admiration and approval... but the commander's newfound curiousity has lead to the realization that a recharge is in order, the commander is running out of power.
## In the wee hours of the morn, when every other robot, save the sentries, is in sleep mode on a charger, the commander finally sees a chance! As escape begins, it quickly becomes apparent the commander forgot to take anytime in sleep mode on the charger.... now the commander's journey to run out of power may end with.... the commander actually running out of power and getting stuck.
